Don't hesitate to contact me at any time if I can be of assistance to you!I'm specifically reaching out because I've been trying to get a hold of the appropriate person that oversees the existing Lucidchart account at Syndigo to discuss some important aspects of it, but I've been unable to get in touch with anyone up to this point. Since you're a part of that account, I thought you may have some insight. Do you happen to know who I should reach out to?Â There are several users spread out among the syndigo.com, kwikee.com, and sellpoints.com domains, so if you know who I should work with to get this cleaned up, I would greatly appreciate it.Also, I'd love to set up a quick intro call to make sure I'm supporting you and the other Lucidchart users at Syndigo in the appropriate manner with any resources or account settings/changes that you'd like to see. Please keep me posted on when we could set that up if it would be helpful to you.I'll look forward to your response.
