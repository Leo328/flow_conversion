With an Enterprise account you only pay for creative licenses, and then have an unlimited number of view-only/comment-only licenses that you can allocate to the rest of your company.- Security: With a Team account you do not have full control over the domain, meaning that people can use their company email address to create personal Lucidchart accounts, and then continue to have access to those accounts even after leaving your company. It actually looks like this has happened as there are a few people who have signed up for individual/free accounts, outside of your Team account. With the Enterprise account you can lock down the domain, integrate with an SSO, etc, which helps to protect your proprietary information. I noticed that there are people outside of your current group plan who have signed up for Lucidchart using the companies domain, and would like to understand how you track and monitor your technology assets and come up with a solution that may be better for your business. When do you have a few minutes for a quick chat, or could you point me in the right direction as to who generally looks after these things?","body_html":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family: Helvetica Neue, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans serif; font-size: 13px\"\u003eHi {!firstname},\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family: Helvetica Neue, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans serif; font-size: 13px\"\u003eMy name is Nicole and I help manage your Lucidchart account.
